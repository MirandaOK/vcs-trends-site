    <h1>Modern VCS</h1>

     <p><b>Navigation</b></p>

        <h3>GitOps</h3>
        <p>The idea is to treat infrastructure configuration and deployment scripts as code in a
Git repository and to use Git workflows (commits, pull requests) to manage changes to those
configurations.</p>

<p><b>Principles of automation and consistency:</b></p>
<ol>
        <li>Single Source of Truth</li>
        <li>Pull Requests for Changes</li>
        <li>Continuous Deployment Automation</li>
    
    
    </ol>

    <h3>Integration with CI/CD Pipelines</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Continuous Integration (CI)</b> - Automatic compiling and running tests to catch any issues quickly</li>
        <li><b>Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)</b> - Delivering changes to staging and production environments and automatic deployment of commits that pasted earlier tests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CI/CD ensures each change is easy to track, change and deploy and because of that leads to a faster release. CI/CD notifies when something is wrong, so developers can fix it more easily and quickly. Because of that, the overall code quality is much better.</p>

    <h3>Hosting repository platforms</h3>

    <p><b>Benefitial functions:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy collaboration</li>
        <li>Integrated issue tracking andproject management</li>
        <li>Built-in CI services</li>
        <li>Social coding</li>
        <li>Access Control and Integrations</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>The most popular platforms:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>GitHub</li>
        <li>GitLab</li>
        <li>Bitbucket</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Role of AI</h3>    
    <p>Nowadays, AI can provide valuable feedback such as pointing out issue in a pull request and advising how to fix them. This way humans can focus on looking for more complicated errors while the simple ones can be caught automatically.</p>

    <h3>Project workflow example</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Feature Branching</li>
        <li>Commits and Local Testing</li>
        <li>Push and Pull Request</li>
        <li>Automated CI Kicks In</li>
        <li>Code Review</li>
        <li>Merge and Deployment</li>
        <li>Monitoring and Rollback</li>
        <li>Collaboration and Tracking</li>
    </ol>
