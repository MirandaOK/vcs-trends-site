    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Version control systems (VCS) are essential tools that help developers manage changes, track modification in files over time, revert changes, collaborate with others and merge their work. </p>

 <h3> Key features</h3>
 <ol>
            <li><b>Repository</b> - The database of fiels, folders and the history</li>
            <li><b>Commit(Check-in)</b> -  Records a set of changes to the repository. Commits usually
include a message describing the change</li>
            <li><b>Update (Pull/Checkout)</b> - Retriving the latest changes from the repository into your
project</li>
            <li><b>Branch</b> -  A parallel line of development â€“ a pointer to a series of commits separate from other lines. Branches allow working on
features or fixes in isolation</li>
            <li><b>Merge</b> -  Combines changes from one branch into another, used to integrate work of different people</li>
            <li><b>Conflict</b> -  When two incompatible changes are made to the same part of a file, a merge conflict occurs</li>
            <li><b>Tag/release</b> -  Marking a specific, significant commit</li> 
            <li><b>Revert</b> -  Undoing a change if it introduces any problems</li>
        </ol>
