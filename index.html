    <p><b>Introduction</b>
    <p>Version control systems (VCS) are essential tools that help track changes in files (usually source code)
over time. They allow multiple people to collaborate on projects, keep a history of modifications, and
revert to earlier versions when needed. </p>

 <p><b> Key features</b></p>
 <ol>
            <li><b>Repository</b> - The database of
all versioned files and their history</li>
            <li><b>Commit(Check-in)</b> -  Saving a set of changes to the repository, creating a new revision. Commits usually
include a message describing the change</li>
            <li><b>Update (Pull/Checkout)</b> - Bringing the latest changes from the repo into your
working copy</li>
            <li><b>Branches</b> -  A parallel line of development â€“ a pointer to a series of commits separate from other lines. Branches allow working on
features or fixes in isolation</li>
            <li><b>Merges</b> -  Integrating changes from one branch into
another. When multiple people edit, merges are how their work is combined</li>
            <li><b>Conflict</b> -  When two changes touch the same part of a file in incompatible ways, a merge conflict occurs</li>
            <li><b>Tag</b> -  Marking a specific commit as a named
version. Useful for release points</li> 
        </ol>
